# Thumbnails of Thai gay magazines of 1980s

If you downloaded all scanned PDFs from http://thairainbowarchive.anu.edu.au/catalogue.htm in the following path `magazine\issueX\magazineX.pdf` (`X` for issue number), you can use simply run `pdf_convert(path)` to turn them into PNG images in this path `magazine\issueX\magazineX-Y.png` (`Y` for page number). Then, run the script to stitch all images in an issue to one wide stripe and later all issues into one single image.

The results are included for reference. All pages are 15-pixel tall. Four selected magazines ran for about 100 issues in 1980's in Thailand. The script is adapted from https://github.com/puripant/one-page-constitution and https://flowingdata.com/2019/04/18/redacted/
